"Embulk v2"
-----------------------

The Embulk project plans a set of big updates in the Embulk core so that Embulk, its community and the eco-system keep sustainable. Backward compatibility in plugins and configurations is considered especially carefully. Other parts, for example command line options, may have some incompatibility. Join discussions if you have concerns or requests!

JFYI: "Embulk v2" is just a code name. The next versions will be still ``0.?``.
